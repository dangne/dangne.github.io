Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the wall to yellow.” It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A^* search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath—a sequence of calls to AI tools. To save the cost of A^* on similar subtasks, we perform inductive reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A^* search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent “FaSTA^*”: fast subtask planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A^* search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA^* is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:var(--blue-color-dark)"> <a href="https://2025.emnlp.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EMNLP 2025</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="balepur2025dixityescandixit" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> Can They Dixit?

To overcome these issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:var(--green-color)"> <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2025</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="liang2025colorbenchvlmsunderstandcolorful" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> ColorBench: Can VLMs See and Understand the Colorful World?

However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:var(--light-cyan-color)"> <a href="https://colmweb.org/2025/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">COLM 2025</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="nguyen2024dynasaurlargelanguageagents" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> DynaSaur 🦖: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions </div> <div class="author"> <em>Dang Nguyen</em>, Viet Dac Lai, Seunghyun Yoon, Ryan A.

While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly-scoped environments, we argue that it presents two major challenges when deploying LLM agents in real-world scenarios: (1) selecting from a fixed set of actions significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) this approach requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which becomes impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. In this work, we propose an LLM agent framework that enables the dynamic creation and composition of actions in an online manner. In this framework, the agent interacts with the environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language at each step. Furthermore, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that this framework offers significantly greater flexibility and outperforms previous methods. Notably, it allows an LLM agent to recover in scenarios where no relevant action exists in the predefined set or when existing actions fail due to unforeseen edge cases. At the time of writing, we hold the top position on the GAIA public leaderboard.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:var(--blue-color)"> <a href="https://2025.aclweb.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ACL 2025</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="DBLP:conf/acl/NguyenCW0PHLWA025" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> GUI Agents: A Survey </div> <div class="author"> <em>Dang Nguyen</em>, Jian Chen, Yu Wang, Gang Wu, Namyong Park, Zhengmian Hu, Hanjia Lyu, Junda Wu, Ryan Aponte, Yu Xia, Xintong Li, Jing Shi, Hongjie Chen, Viet Dac Lai, Zhouhang Xie, Sungchul Kim, Ruiyi Zhang, Tong Yu, Md.

While conditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can potentially improve LLM controllability, curating new SFT data to fulfill the constraints usually relies on human experts or proprietary LLMs, which is time-consuming and expensive. To bridge this gap, we propose Rule-based Data Recycling (RuleR), a human/LLM-free data augmentation method incorporating multiple constraints into the original SFT data. Instead of creating new responses from scratch, RuleR integrates linguistic or formatting rules into the original instructions and modifies the responses to fulfill the rule-defined constraints. Training on the "recycled" data consolidates LLMs capability to generate constrained outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate RuleR’s effectiveness in improving LLM controllability while maintaining general instruction-following performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:var(--blue-color)"> <a href="https://2024.aclweb.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ACL 2024</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="nguyen-etal-2024-multi" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title"> Multi-Objective Linguistic Control of Large Language Models </div> <div class="author"> <em>Dang Nguyen</em>, Jiuhai Chen, and Tianyi Zhou </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16229" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/tianyi-lab/mctune" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Large language models (LLMs), despite their breakthroughs on many challenging benchmark tasks, prefer to generate verbose responses and lack the controllability of output complexity, which is usually preferred by human users in practice.

To this end, we propose multi-control tuning (MCTune), which includes multiple linguistic complexity values of ground-truth responses as controls in the input for instruction tuning. We finetune LLaMA2-7B on Alpaca-GPT4 and WizardLM datasets.

The data can be poisoned to make a trained model misbehave when a predefined trigger pattern appears, granting the attackers illegal benefits. While most proposed backdoor attacks are dirty-label, clean-label attacks are more desirable by keeping data labels unchanged to dodge human inspection. However, designing a working clean-label attack is a challenging task, and existing clean-label attacks show underwhelming performance. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to develop clean-label attacks with outstanding attack performance. The key component is a trigger pattern generator, which is trained together with a surrogate model in an alternating manner. Our proposed mechanism is flexible and customizable, allowing different backdoor trigger types and behaviors for either single or multiple target labels. Our backdoor attacks can reach near-perfect attack success rates and bypass all state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, as illustrated via comprehensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets.

Concurrently, several studies on adversarial images have observed an intriguing property: the adversarial images tend to leave the low-dimensional natural data manifold. In this study, we find a similar phenomenon occurs in the contextualized embedding space of natural sentences induced by pretrained language models in which textual adversarial examples tend to have their embeddings diverge off the manifold of natural sentence embeddings. Based on this finding, we propose Textual Manifold-based Defense (TMD), a defense mechanism that learns the embedding space manifold of the underlying language model and projects novel inputs back to the approximated structure before classification. Through extensive experiments, we find that our method consistently and significantly outperforms previous defenses under various attack settings while remaining unaffected to the clean accuracy.
