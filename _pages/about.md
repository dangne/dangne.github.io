I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), where I am advised by Professor [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). Previously, I was an AI Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://vinai.io/) (now acquired by [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-residency-program)), working under the mentorship of Professor [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/). I received my B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/).

My research focuses on **Large Foundation Models (LFMs) as agents that act via programmatic actions**, often referred to as **code agents** (e.g., [DynaSaur 🦖](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747) and [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)). I am particularly interested in improving agent performance on real-world tasks by improving the capabilities of the underlying LFMs, rather than relying on complex agent scaffolding.

Toward this goal, my work centers around three recurring questions:

1. **Characterizing failure modes** of code agents across different base LFMs (e.g., small vs. large, open- vs. closed-source, reasoning vs. non-reasoning),
2. **Understanding why these failures occur** through the lens of language model interpretability and programmatic analysis,
3. **Developing new learning methods** to mitigate these failure modes.
