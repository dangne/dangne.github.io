Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Dang Nguyen, and I am a CS Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/). My research centers around applying language models as agents to make optimal sequential decisions.

<!-- Questions that I am currently interested in are: -->
<!-- 1. How can we enable compositional generalization in language agents? [through composable action sets, as explored in ([DynaSaur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747))].
2. How can we obtain data for agent fine-tuning in a scalable way? -->

Before joining UMD, I earned my B.E. degree in Computer Engineering at the [Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology](https://hcmut.edu.vn/) and worked as an AI Resident at [VinAI Research](https://vinai.io/), advised by Professor [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io/).
