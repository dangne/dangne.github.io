**One** [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02878) accepted to **EMNLP 2022**. We show the first empirical evidence that the [off-manifold conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07690) holds for natural language adversarial examples, and then propose a defense mechanism that projects adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural sentence embeddings before classification.
